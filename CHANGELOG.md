  (`brand.retrieve`), plus Yahoo Finance `yahoo_finance.lookup`. Regenerated from
  the public API contract.

## 1.5.0-sdk.3

  per operation (Steep/Sorbet users get real signatures instead of `**untyped`).

  private helpers, enabled tuned rubocop metric budgets, and hardened multipart
  `Content-Disposition` field/filename escaping. No public API changes.

  description, and add `documentation_uri` / `source_code_uri` / `bug_tracker_uri`
  metadata for a richer RubyGems listing. No client or API changes.

  calls for every public operation, generated from the shared OpenAPI contract.

  support; `on_retry` hook.
- Numeric and cursor pagination (`paginate` / `paginate_items`).
- `before_request` / `after_response` middleware, opt-in `request_id` and
  `idempotency_keys`, client-side `rate_limit` / `max_concurrency`.
